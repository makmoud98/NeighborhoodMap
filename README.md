# NeighborhoodMap
This is my 5th project for my full-stack nanodegree course by udacity.  
This webpage features the use of the google maps javascript api along with foursquare api to retrieve some information with the help of knockout.js, bootstrap, and jquery.  
Small segments of code were adopted from the google maps javascript api documentation and from my course examples https://github.com/udacity/ud864
