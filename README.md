# NeighborhoodMap
this is my 5th project for my full-stack nanodegree course by udacity.
this webpage features the google maps javascript api along with foursquare api to retreive some information.
knockout.js, bootstrap, and jquery were used here.
small segments of code were adopted from the google maps javascript api documentation and from my course examples https://github.com/udacity/ud864

just open index.html with a modern web browser to view the webpage
